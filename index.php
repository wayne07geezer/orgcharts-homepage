                        <h5>In an organization so informal, why have a formal mentoring program?</h5>
                        <p>We absorb people at a fairly high rate, relative to the size of our organization. As an organization of less than sixty people, even if we hire 10 new people every year, that is a significant number.<br><br>
                        This program will facilitate their integration, retention and growth to the advantage of both the individual and our organization. The purpose of this program is to give new members the opportunity for professional and personal counselling that is apart from, but complementary to the usual reporting structure.<br><br>
                        This document is a framework for this system.</p>   
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <div class="mp-carou-img">
                            <img class="" src="img/mentoring-program/Icon_02.svg" alt=" ">
                        </div>
                        <h5>Who are the participants in this Program?</h5>
                        <p>The beneficiary of the program is the ‘Mentee’; who is presumed to be a relatively recent recruit to our company, has the potential to grow to higher levels and so far has a moderate awareness of our culture.<br><br>
                        Mentors (our wrath will descend on anyone who calls them ‘Mental’!) are selected on the basis of being positive role models, with the ability to coach and the maturity to provide meaningful observations and suggestions.
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <div class="mp-carou-img">
                            <img class="" src="img/mentoring-program/Icon_03.svg" alt=" ">
                        </div>
                        <h5>What are the specific steps in this program?</h5>
                        <ol class="alpha-list custom-list" type="a">
                            <li>A formal meeting will be scheduled by the mentor, once-a-month in the first three months and once-in-six-weeks for the next three months or so of the Mentee’s stay in Synapse. These meetings should be held off the Monte Carlo premises, in a neutral environment that affords privacy. Moderate amounts spent on refreshments will be reimbursed by the company.</li>
                            <li>To encourage openness and the resolution of real issues, no formal minutes of meetings need to be maintained, but notes taken as a ‘memory aid’ and shared transparently may be used if agreeable to both.</li>
                            <li>The discussions will be confidential, except in situation when sharing the information selectively with senior members is very important for resolving an issue that the Mentee is  grappling with.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The written feedback form will track how well the Mentee has immersed himself into the organization.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <div class="mp-carou-img">
                            <img class="image-four" src="img/mentoring-program/Icon_04.svg" alt=" ">
                        </div>
                        <h5>What is the broad framework?</h5>
                        <p>There are several dimensions to mentoring. The Relationship is the underlying structure on which the entire transaction is based and on which the Mentor will maximize the Mentee’s potential.  A bond of trust is essential to the Mentee’s ability to engage in an open dialogue, spend time considering the Mentor’s viewpoint and make decisions.  Mentees should enter mentoring with the presumption that Mentors are concerned about their development.<br><br>
                        Mentees should provide mentors with a clear picture of their background, motivations, goals and plans. Both parties need to engage with an open mind.  The Mentee who appears overly interested in being right should not be surprised if the Mentor points out that a refusal to consider reasonable alternatives is a shortcoming.<br><br>
                        To avoid being defensive will be a challenge for both the Mentor as well as the Mentee.<br><br>
                        This model emphasizes that the Mentors central purpose is to motivate and support the Mentee.  Mentees must be prepared to deal with sensitive subjects, given of course, that there will never be unnecessary intrusion by the Mentor. For instance, Mentees who signal that they see ‘lack of interest’ as a reason to not participate more actively in company activities may anticipate that Mentors will question this attitude.</p>

                        <h5>What are the things that a Mentor and Mentee should do?</h5>
                        <p><span class="custom-text">Here is a handy checklist for the Mentor</span></p>
                        <ul class="alpha-list02 custom-list">
                            <li>Set up the first meeting, outside of work time, within a week after being matched</li>
                            <li>Share information about your background and professional experiences</li>
                            <li>Help the Mentee clarify goals, explain clearly what the Mentee can expect from you and the company </li>
                            <li>Set up a schedule with your Mentee for regular meetings and feedback sessions.</li>
                            <li>Compile a list of activities with Mentee which meet mutual goals</li>
                            <li>Share the progress with the Director at the end of the month</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><span class="custom-text">And here is a simple one for the Mentee</span></p>
                        <ul class="alpha-list02 custom-list">
                            <li>Share information about your background, needs, values and aspirations as honestly as you can</li>
                            <li>Give importance to the program. If your Mentor hasnot made time for a meeting with you, go up to him and politely ask when this is possible. Prepare for the meetings by clarifying and organizing your thoughts</li>
                            <li>With your Mentor, decide what systematic steps need to be taken to make your experience in Synapse richer and more rewarding for you and for the company.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <div class="mp-carou-img">

                        </div>
                        <h5>What is a Brand? And why bother about ‘branding’?</h5>
                        <p>A brand is essentially a name. But the entire discipline of Branding (thinking of the right name for something, designing its visual representation, assigning it meanings) is actually more concerned with its relation to ‘Positioning’- the science of establishing what the name means and ensuring that every step in its communication is consistent with the organization’s strategic objectives.<br><br>So why should we worry about what the brand of our organization means or should mean? Well, for at least two reasons:</p>
                        <ol class="alpha-list03 custom-list" type="a">
                            <li><span class="custom-text">The Brand influences Clients:</span> Our unique business model means that we do not ‘cold-call’ on prospects and offer our services. We need business to come to us. But for this to happen, our brand must stand for something that attracts a prospect, that makes him want to entrust our business to us and also tell others about us</li>
                            <li><span class="custom-text">The Brand influences Members:</span> As an organization that is entirely in the knowledge capital business, our greatest strength is our people. If our people are winners, we win. But even to attract the best people, our brand must resonate with some meaning that  they admire</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>So it is clear that for our company brand to be able to fulfill its organizational need for business as well as its social objective, our brand must have a meaning that is clear and consistent. Our brand must have a meaning that is clear and consistent.</p>
                        <ol class="alpha-list03 custom-list" type="i">
                            <li><span class="custom-text">Intelligence.</span> An intelligence that leans towards sharpness more than the kind measured in IQ tests. And this intelligence should be founded in <span class="custom-text"> Knowledge.</span> Knowledge that shows we are specialists in information, no matter which angle our skills make us approach it-as Content specialists, as Design specialists, as Technology specialists, as Management specialists…</li>
                            <li><span class="custom-text">Passionate Integrity</span> in our professional approach. That we   believe in a few things and we stand for what we believe in. That we are individuals with a difference, and who want to make a difference. Who care about a client, care about his business results, care about making a difference to his work.  That we can be trusted implicitly not to make a biased recommendation or inflate costing or want to get away with mediocre work. That we are not the products of a corporate template who say and do things because they are expected to or because they are trendy, but because we are guided by the strength and clarity of our beliefs</li>
                            <li><span class="custom-text">‘Scientific’</span> and ‘Analytical’ approach in everything we do. The belief that we apply thought and the rigor of the scientific process to everything we do</li>
                            <li><span class="custom-text">Unique!</span> We should be unique (without appearing to try desperately to be different) in everything that we do. People should marvel at our Imagination.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Therefore our brand should primarily stand for Intelligence, Knowledge and Integrity. So how can we communicate these ‘brand attributes’ to the world?<br><br>Consumer product companies that use the mass media to forcefully try and assign certain attributes to their brands, we do not. And in a world that grows cynical by the day, it is anyway foolish to expect that consumers will believe a jingle which says that a two-minute noodle stands for caring motherhood or an advertisement which says that a tiny organization in Goa stands for revolution in business.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <div class="mp-carou-img">
                            <img class="" src="img/mentoring-program/Icon_07.svg" alt=" ">
                        </div>
                        <h5>So how do we communicate what our brand stands for?</h5>
                        <p>We have to let our actions speak louder than our words. And realize that practically speaking, 99% of people will make a 100% impression about us from either of 5 means:</p>
                        <ol class="alpha-list03 custom-list">
                            <li><span class="custom-text"> Our People:</span> Our people need to be intelligent, knowledgeable, have integrity and shine with the passionate belief in their work and the difference it can make to the client. Met informally at a party, a conference, an airplane journey…our people should be indelible individuals and not forgettable stereotypes</li>
                            <li><span class="custom-text"> Our Communication Media:</span> Our presentations, our brochures, the letters or proposals that we send, the alumni newsletter, our invoices….and above all our website will lead people to form strong impressions about us even before they have met us</li>
                            <li><span class="custom-text"> Our Projects:</span> A prospect may form a very positive impression about us from the first two points above. But if we do not display the same level of excellence in our project work; if our deliverables do not radiate intelligence, knowledge and professional integrity then all will come to naught</li>
                            <li><span class="custom-text"> Our Interactions:</span> The quality and finish in a client report, our level of preparedness in our presentations, our comfort and confidence when we meet people from outside (prospects or clients visiting Monte Carlo, prospective employees), the intelligence of questions asked to a guest faculty, the civility and grace displayed during a neighborhood party in Dona Paula, our behaviour at a group outing for a movie or picnic…all these will send signals to people about who we really are. And these signals will be amplified every time they are transmitted from one person (who has an impression about our company) to another</li>
                            <li><span class="custom-text"> Our Centre:</span> Is our office sparkling and clean, is our network a model for small networks, is our intranet a delight or a disaster, are the gardens and grounds in a state of maintenance or neglect, are our leisure activitiesa reflection of our sparkling curiosity or a tired adherence to an unpleasant duty…Our ‘home’ will either be the best testimony to our beliefs, or its most visible negation</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>So we are the carriers of our company’s brand. The brand     ambassadors, the advertisement campaign, the packaging, the retail POP material…everything. As long as we remember this and are guided in our actions by it, then our brand will consistently communicate the intended positive image we want it to.</p>
