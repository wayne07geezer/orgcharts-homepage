            <p>Each person is expected not only to ‘buy-in’ to our culture but also be its torch-bearer. And an important moment where this is tested is in how we solve the big and small problems that come-up in our everyday work. While we are always open to evolving our culture with the participation of our people, there is no place for cynicism or non-constructive criticism.</p>
            <h3>SO WHAT IS<br>CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM?<br><span class="custom-text03">It takes the following path. </span></h3>

            <img class="icon-cm" src="img/solving-problems/Icon_01.png" alt="">
            <p>You would<br> identify a problem</p>

            <img class="icon-cm" src="img/solving-problems/Icon_02.png" alt="">
            <p>You would then take the trouble to<br> separate the symptom from the<br> cause, not go running around<br> pointing out a symptom that<br> everyone is aware of anyway</p>

            <p>You would be very sensitive and avoid<br> converting ‘Action items’ into ‘Issues’.<br> A tap leaking is an action item that<br> needs to be addressed, it is by itself not<br> an ‘Issue’ about poor maintenance</p>

            <p>You would take great care to<br> avoid ‘sensationalizing’ or making<br> sweeping comments about<br> problems. You would also be very<br> careful not to bolster your point<br> of view by quoting someone else<br> at our organization out of context</p>

            <p>You would place the problem in<br> perspective- keep in mind the<br> financial, cultural and operational<br> reality of Our organization </p>

            <p>You would think very hard and<br> suggest a solution for it. If you<br> absolutely cannot, then you<br> would think twice about bringing<br> it up since others may have<br> thought about it and failed to<br> come to a conclusion</p>
